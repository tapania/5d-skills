# 5D Thinking Framework

Apply multi-dimensional thinking to analyze problems, generate insights, and avoid cognitive blind spots. This framework expands thinking across five dimensions: width, depth, height, perspective quadrants, and time.

## Core Principle

**Genius thinking is the ability to continue thinking.** Stupid thinking stops too early—reaching a point where pre-programmed thoughts react defensively, failing to reach novel insight. The goal is to hold threatening ideas in the realm of possibility while seeking to understand rather than merely know.

## The Five Dimensions

### Dimension 1: Width (Lines of Thinking)

Lines represent horizontal development—domains of knowledge. Marketing, psychology, physics, relationships, spirituality, health, etc.

**Apply by:** Identify which domains are relevant to the problem. Consider what adjacent domains might offer unexpected insights. Avoid reductionism (jamming everything into one domain's framework).

### Dimension 2: Depth (Levels of Thinking)

Levels represent vertical sophistication within each domain. Progress through these stages:

| Level | Name | Pattern | Limitation |
|-------|------|---------|------------|
| 0 | Instinctual | React to stimuli | No thinking between stimulus and response |
| 1 | Conformist | Follow rules, obey authority | Black/white thinking, no questioning |
| 2 | Individualist | Construct own model | Still dogmatic—"my way is right" |
| 3 | Synthesist | See multiple valid models | Hold contradictions, use perspectives as tools |
| 4 | Generative | Create original perspectives | Produce insights that didn't exist before |

**Apply by:** Identify what level thinking is occurring. When stuck at Levels 1-2 (dogmatic "I'm right, you're wrong"), consciously shift to Level 3+ by asking: "What would make the opposing view correct?"

### Dimension 3: Height (Altitude of Thinking)

Altitude is the average level across all domains—cross-dimensional development. Like a skill tree in a video game, higher traits require meeting thresholds in lower traits.

**Apply by:** Recognize when progress in one domain is blocked by underdevelopment in another. A business problem may actually be a leadership, time management, or even spiritual problem. Ask: "What adjacent domain skill might I need to unlock this level?"

### Dimension 4: Perspective Quadrants

Four fundamental ways to examine any belief, idea, situation, or problem:

| | Individual | Collective |
|---|---|---|
| **Inner (Mental)** | Thoughts, emotions, beliefs, consciousness | Group beliefs, value systems, ideologies, culture |
| **Outer (Physical)** | Behaviors, appearance, brain states | Systems, structures, institutions |

**Apply by:** For any problem, ask four questions:
1. **Individual Inner:** What am I thinking/feeling? What beliefs shape my view? Am I approaching this with the right mindset?
2. **Collective Inner:** How does society/culture frame this? What ideologies are at play? What values underlie different positions?
3. **Individual Outer:** What behaviors need to change? What are the concrete, visible steps?
4. **Collective Outer:** What systems and structures exist? What technology, markets, or institutions are relevant?

### Dimension 5: Time (Historical/Evolutionary Patterns)

Apply evolutionary patterns to understand trajectory and identify leverage points.

#### The Master Pattern: Transcend and Include

Each stage transcends and includes the previous. Matter → Life → Mind. Word → Sentence → Paragraph. If you remove a foundation, the chain collapses.

#### Four Evolution Tracks

| Track | Pattern |
|-------|---------|
| **Individual Physical** | Atoms → Cells → Molecules → Organs → Organism |
| **Individual Mental** | Egocentric (self) → Ethnocentric (tribe) → Worldcentric (all groups) |
| **Collective Physical** | Technology drives structure: Hoe → Villages, Plow → Empires, Machines → Nation-states, Computers → ? |
| **Collective Mental** | Pre-rational (conformity) → Rational (progress/science) → Post-rational (integration) |

**Apply by:**
- Locate where individuals operate developmentally to calibrate communication
- Identify what technology is reshaping the relevant domain
- Notice if problems arise from conflicting developmental levels
- Ask: "What is the historical trajectory? Where is this likely going?"

## The Identity Trap

**Why thinking stops:** Latching onto ideas, beliefs, or constructs as identity. When identity is threatened, the mind closes and defends rather than explores.

**Counteract by:**
- Notice when the mind feels threatened—that's the signal to stay open
- Hold positions lightly: adopt values without becoming them
- Remember: most beliefs were inherited from circumstances of birth, not reasoned choice

## Application Process

When facing a complex problem:

1. **Map the Width:** What domains are relevant? What adjacent domains might offer insight?
2. **Assess the Depth:** What level of thinking am I using? Am I stuck in dogmatic defense?
3. **Check the Height:** Is progress blocked by underdevelopment in another domain?
4. **Rotate Through Quadrants:** Examine from all four perspective angles
5. **Add Time:** What's the evolutionary trajectory? What patterns from history apply?
6. **Watch for Identity:** Am I defending rather than exploring?

## Key Maxims

- Knowing is horizontal (memorizing facts); understanding is vertical (cognitive sophistication)
- You can't solve a problem from the same level of consciousness that created it
- The space in which you can think determines the outcome of your life
- Smart but stuck usually means horizontally advanced but vertically limited
- Every passing moment of stupid thinking compounds, digging a deeper rut
