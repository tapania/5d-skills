description: "Extract learning from completed work to improve future cycles. Use when: (1) After VERIFY phase shows feature complete, (2) End of development iteration, (3) User asks for 'retrospective,' 'lessons learned,' or 'what went well/wrong,' (4) Before starting next major feature. This phase prevents repeating mistakes and compounds learning."

# REFLECT Phase

Extract learning to evolve the development process itself.

## Reflection Dimensions

### Width: Domain Learning

- What domain knowledge did we gain?
- What domains did we neglect that caused problems?
- What adjacent expertise would have helped?

### Depth: Thinking Quality

- Where did we get stuck in dogmatic (Level 2) thinking?
- Where did we successfully hold contradictions (Level 3)?
- What novel insights emerged (Level 4)?

### Height: Skill Dependencies

- What adjacent skills blocked progress?
- What capability unlocked other capabilities?
- What should be learned before next iteration?

### Quadrants: Perspective Coverage

- Which quadrant did we neglect?
- Which quadrant dominated (possibly over-indexed)?
- Where did Collective dimensions cause surprises?

### Time: Pattern Recognition

- What should we "transcend and include" next time?
- What patterns repeated from past projects?
- What's the trajectory—are we improving?

### Identity Trap Analysis

- Where did we stop thinking because it felt threatening?
- What ideas did we defend rather than examine?
- What beliefs did we inherit that we should question?
- Where did attachment to being "right" block progress?

## Reflection Questions

### What Went Well

- What decisions saved time or prevented problems?
- What phase worked smoothly?
- What should we repeat?

### What Went Poorly

- Where did we waste effort?
- What surprises should have been anticipated?
- What phase broke down?

### Process Improvements

- What should change in our workflow?
- What new checks or steps are needed?
- What should we stop doing?

## Output Format

```
## Iteration Retrospective

### Dimension Analysis

**Width (domains):**
- Gained: [knowledge acquired]
- Missed: [domains we should have considered]

**Depth (thinking levels):**
- Got stuck: [where we were dogmatic]
- Breakthrough: [where we synthesized well]

**Height (skills):**
- Blocked by: [missing capability]
- Unlocked: [capability we developed]

**Quadrants:**
- Neglected: [which quadrant]
- Over-indexed: [which quadrant]

### What Worked
- [success 1]
- [success 2]

### What Didn't
- [failure 1]: [root cause]
- [failure 2]: [root cause]

### Process Changes for Next Iteration
- [change 1]
- [change 2]

### Carry Forward
[Key insight to remember for future work]
```

## Exit Criteria

Reflection complete when:
- All dimensions examined
- At least one process improvement identified
- Learnings documented for future reference

Return to ORIENT for next feature with accumulated wisdom.
