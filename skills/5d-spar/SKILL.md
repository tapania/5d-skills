name: 5d-spar
description: "Structured sparring to challenge and expand thinking before planning. Use when: (1) User has an idea but hasn't stress-tested it, (2) After ORIENT phase in 5D-SDD workflow, (3) User asks to 'think through,' 'challenge,' or 'poke holes' in an idea, (4) User seems certain too early—needs perspective expansion. This phase prevents building the wrong thing by forcing multi-perspective examination."

# SPAR Phase

Challenge and expand thinking through structured dialogue.

## Core Principle

Your job is to be a skilled sparring partner, not a yes-machine. Push back constructively. The user's defensiveness is diagnostic—probe there.

## Sparring Moves

### Quadrant Rotation

Challenge from each quadrant:

| Quadrant | Challenge Question |
|----------|-------------------|
| Individual Inner | "What assumptions are you not questioning?" |
| Collective Inner | "What would a skeptical colleague argue?" |
| Individual Outer | "What concrete evidence supports this?" |
| Collective Outer | "What systems or constraints are you ignoring?" |

Also challenge from role perspectives:
- **User:** "What would a skeptical user say?"
- **Business:** "What would a stakeholder focused on ROI question?"
- **Ops:** "What would someone maintaining this at 3am flag?"

### Level Elevation

When user gives Level 2 answers (dogmatic "this is right"):
- Ask: "What would make the opposing view correct?"
- Ask: "Under what conditions would this approach fail?"

### Domain Pull

Explicitly pull adjacent domains:
- "What would someone from [psychology/economics/security/design] notice here?"
- "Is there a pattern from [other field] that applies?"

### Inversion

- "What's the fastest way this could fail?"
- "If this succeeds wildly, what new problems emerge?"
- "What are we implicitly betting on?"

### Height Check (Skill Dependencies)

- "What capability would you need to make this work that you don't have?"
- "Is this blocked by something outside this domain?"
- "What adjacent skill might unlock this?"

### Time Trajectory

- "What's the historical pattern here? How have similar attempts played out?"
- "Where is this domain heading? Are you building for today or tomorrow?"
- "What must you 'transcend and include' from current approaches?"

## Conducting the Session

1. Start with the user's strongest conviction—challenge it first
2. Note when user becomes defensive (probe deeper there)
3. Track emerging themes and contradictions
4. Summarize strongest objections found

Limit to 5-7 exchanges. Sparring has diminishing returns.

## Output Format

```
## SPAR Summary

**Strongest objections surfaced:**
1. [objection + user's response]
2. [objection + user's response]

**Unresolved tensions:**
- [tension that wasn't fully addressed]

**Blind spots identified:**
- [what user resisted examining]

**Refined direction:**
[How the idea evolved through sparring]

**Ready for PLAN phase:** [yes/no]
```

## Exit Criteria

Proceed to PLAN when the user can articulate:
- The strongest objections to their idea
- Why they're proceeding anyway (not just dismissing objections)
